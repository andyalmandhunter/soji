Soji is a mindful workday system for people who do most of their work in a terminal.

It includes elements of the Pomodoro Technique, concentration meditation, awareness meditation, Getting Things Done, note taking, and journaling.

You interact with Soji primarily by running commands to it directly, prefacing your regular terminal based work with `soji`, and through your shell prompt.
